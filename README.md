This example illustrates a comparison between the periods of different years against a Target for active year. In this case, we are comparing sales figures for the quarters in 2016 vs 2017. The target values for the 2017 quarters are represented by a line with inline labels. Each quarter’s exact value is also noted at the top for accurate reporting. There are two x-axis in use to represent the 2 years and create spacing between the quarters.

This example uses Mike Bostock’s inline labels example: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4b66c0d9be9a0d56484e
